		<p>I'm 43 years old from Tel Aviv. I have a beautiful Doberman, his name is Justin.</p>

		<p>My experience in SEO has instilled strong analytical and problem-solving skills, along with a meticulous eye for detail. I'm adept at identifying and troubleshooting website issues, which translates well to the world of QA testing. I'm confident that my ability to analyze user experience (UX)  would be valuable in ensuring software functionality meets user needs.</p>
		<p>Attention to Detail: SEO requires meticulous keyword research, competitor analysis, and on-page optimization, all demanding a keen eye for detail – a crucial skill for QA.
		   Analytical Thinking: SEO involves analyzing website traffic, user behavior, and search engine algorithms to identify areas for improvement. This analytical thinking translates well to identifying and diagnosing software bugs.
		   Problem-Solving: SEOs constantly troubleshoot website issues related to ranking or user experience. This problem-solving mindset is invaluable for a QA tester who needs to identify the root cause of software bugs.
		   Understanding User Experience (UX): SEO prioritizes optimizing websites for user experience, ensuring smooth navigation and functionality. This aligns with a QA tester's focus on ensuring a positive user experience with software.</p>

		<p>I'm a big believer in self-directed learning, and online tutorials have become my go-to resource for acquiring new tech skills. They allow me to explore at my own pace and delve deep into specific areas that pique my interest.</p>
		<p>But my true passion lies in QA and debugging code. There's something incredibly satisfying about untangling complex issues and ensuring everything functions smoothly. Debugging code is like solving a puzzle for me. I love the intellectual challenge of working through problems and finding elegant fixes.</p>
		<p>I'm a highly organized and detail-oriented individual with a strong emphasis on thoroughness in my work.</p>
